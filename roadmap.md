Apologies for the confusion earlier.

Here's a roadmap to help you build BookBuddy using the 20 moods and their associated books you've provided:

Phase 1: Planning and Conceptualization
Define Objectives

Primary Goal: Create a website where users select a mood and receive a list of 10 book recommendations associated with that mood.
Target Audience: Readers looking for book suggestions based on their current mood.
List of Moods and Books

Use the 20 moods and their corresponding 10 books each as your initial dataset.
Phase 2: Design the User Experience (UX/UI)
Mood Selection Interface

Visual Elements: Use icons or images representing each mood to make selection intuitive.
Layout: Consider a grid or carousel layout for moods on the homepage.
Book Recommendation Page

Display Format: Show book covers, titles, authors, and brief descriptions.
Navigation: Include options to return to mood selection or explore other moods.
Consistent Branding

Color Scheme and Typography: Choose colors and fonts that evoke the essence of reading and match the moods.
Phase 3: Database Setup
Choose a Database System

Options: SQLite (for simplicity), PostgreSQL, or MySQL.
Design Database Schema

Tables Needed:
Moods Table: Mood_ID, Mood_Name, Mood_Description.
Books Table: Book_ID, Title, Author, Description, Cover_Image_URL, Mood_ID (foreign key).
Populate the Database

Input all 20 moods and their associated 10 books into the database manually or via a script.
Phase 4: Development
Backend Development

Select a Technology Stack:
Languages: Python (Django/Flask), JavaScript (Node.js), or PHP (Laravel).
API Development:
Create endpoints to fetch moods and books based on user interactions.
Example Endpoints:
GET /api/moods – Retrieves all moods.
GET /api/moods/{id}/books – Retrieves books associated with a specific mood.
Frontend Development

Frameworks: Use React.js, Vue.js, or vanilla JavaScript with HTML/CSS.
Mood Selection Page:
Fetch and display moods from the backend.
Implement hover effects and clickable mood cards.
Book Display Page:
